Project News Site - https://splendid-paletas-c8ee80.netlify.app/

🏁 Goals:

To create a news site using boxmodel (flexbox & gridbox) and learn how to use HTML and CSS when structuring a webpage. I was also to make the page responsive.

Must-have requirements:

✅ Use boxmodel (both flexbox & gridbox).

✅ Make the webpage responsive on mobile, tablet and desktop.

🚧 The problem:

For my first project ever, I started deciding on the structure and building the navbar. I then went on with the use of the flexbox news splash, only to move on with the gridbox articles. I struggled with understanding the structure when designing with both flex- and gridbox, but learnt A LOT from this project. I also used Github for the first time along with the terminal, which in itself, was quite a bit to wrap my head around.

If I had more time, I would have worked on the design and structure.
